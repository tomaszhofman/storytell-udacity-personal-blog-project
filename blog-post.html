              Queensland's Premier and Chief Health Officer are reassuring
              people about the safety of the state's COVID-19 vaccination
              program, as the state government prepares to administer the first
              jabs on the Gold Coast tomorrow.

                Thousands of vaccine doses have arrived in Cairns and Brisbane,
              with the first group of people, including the Prime Minister,
              already receiving the shot in Sydney on Sunday.

                transmission in Queensland, the rollout of the vaccine will be

                told when it's your turn,"</b

              Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. "We hope to vaccinate more
              than 1,000 Queenslanders in the first week of this rollout. "And
              over the next four to six weeks, we hope that there'll be 125,000
              people in total vaccinated under category 1a.

              Recruiters who work for contingent recruiting agencies usually
              work on multiple clients at the same time, therefore it’s much
              harder for them to engage in a more spontaneous communication with
              stakeholders at your company. They also don’t actively participate
              in your company’s life and don’t join your communication channels
              like Slack, which doesn’t give them the opportunity to get to know
              your team and the culture of your organisation.

              "We get vaccinated for a whole range of diseases. We've been doing
              that all of our life, and immunisation is really important." Chief
              Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said it was the moment she had
              been waiting for, since the start of the pandemic. "What a
              response we've had from the world scientists to have developed a
              vaccine that is so safe and so effective so quickly," Dr Young
              said.

              Despite research by the Federal Health Department showing more
              than half of the adult population still had reservations about the
              vaccines, the State Government was now moving to boost confidence
              in them. Dr Young said: "I'll be there getting vaccinated, with
              whichever vaccine is offered to me, both of them are fantastic
              vaccines, the Pfizer vaccine or the Astra Zeneca vaccine, they
              great."
